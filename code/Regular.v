(** * Regular expressions *)

(** The _regular expressions_ are defined as simple expressions that denote the languages
    accepted by finite automata. 

    We would like to define the three operations on languages that the operators of
    regular expressions represent. 

    - The _union_ of two languages L and M , denoted %L\cup M%, is the set of strings that
      are either in L or in M, or in both. As a simple example, if L= { 1,01,013} and 
      M = {10,2} , then %L\cup M% = {1,01,013,10,2}. In Coq notation, it is defined as:
      
      << 
     Definition lang_union (a:Alphabet)(l1:Language a)(l2:Language a):Language a :=
         fun w:Word a =>  l1 w \/ l2 w.
      >>

    - The _concatenation_ of languages L and M is the set of words that can be formed by taking 
      any string in L and concatenating it with any string in M. For example, if 
      [L= {101, 23, 9)] and [M={3,4}] , then [L * M = {1013, 1014, 233, 234, 93, 94}]. In Coq, we represent it as :
      
      <<
      Definition lang_conc(a:Alphabet)(l1:Language a)(l2:Language a):Language a :=
    fun w:Word a => exists w1:Word a, exists w2:Word a,  w1 ++ w2=w /\ l1 w1 /\ l2 w2.
      >>

    

    - The _Kleene operator_  (closure) represents the set of words that  can be produced by taking any number
      of words from L, and concatenating all of them. 

     L* = L( L^2) (L^3) (.... L^n ...
     
     In the _Languages_ section, we have proved some useful properties concerning concatenation as
     well as union and Kleene operator 



*)

(** Defining the regular expression as an inductive term .
   
    Below, we make use of 7 constructors according to specific rules . The explanation are
    as follows:



    - the _[empty]_ expression represents a regular expression and denotes the empty set
   
    - [epsilon] is a regular expression and denotes the set [{epsilon}]
   
    - For each [a : Alphabet ] , _a_ is a regular expression and denotes the set [{a}]

    - If [r] and [s] are regular expressions, then [r+s] is a regular expression denoting
     the _union_ of L(r) and L(s), i.e L(r+s) = %L(r)\cup L(s)% . 

    - If [r] and [s] are regular expressions, then [rs] is a regular expression , denoting the
     _concatenation_ of [L(r)] and [L(s)] i.e L(rs) = $L(r) \cap L(s)$

    - If [r] is a regular expression, then [r*] is a regular expression, denoting the closure of
      [L(r)] . That is, [L(r* )= L(r)]
    
    - If [r] is a regular expression, then [(r)] is also a regular expression, denoting the exactly
      the same language like [r]. I.e, [L((r)) = L(r)]
